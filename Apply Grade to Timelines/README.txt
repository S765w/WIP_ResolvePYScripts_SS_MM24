Apply Grade to Timelines Script

This Python script is designed to automate the process of applying predefined colour grades to multiple timelines in DaVinci Resolve. It uses .drx files to apply the grade and its properties to all clips and timelines within a project.

DRX Path Options:

The script requires the path to a .drx file that contains the desired colour grade. This path is specified in the script with the variable 'grade_path'. You can change this to any path you prefer.


How to Use

Ensure resolve is open before running the script
Run the script using Visual Studio Code
When prompted enter the path of the .drx files located in a folder on the server i.e. /Users/samuel/Projects/IKEA IMC/Projects/Campaign 0001/ColourGrades/Grade 1 Warm.drx
